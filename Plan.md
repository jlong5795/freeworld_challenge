# General Requirements

Given a list of students with revenue potentials and hours of instruction needed, as well as the max instruction hours per cohort, find the maximum earnings you can generate from the student cohort where the sum of the instruction hours are less than or equal to the max instruction hours.

## Solution Plan

1. Recreate example data to be used as default state
2. Create view for sample data that also supports being able to update that information
3. Implement function to evaluate return by student
4. Create a new array of accepted students based on criteria
5. Display currently accepted students and total potential
